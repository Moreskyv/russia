                                <p class="sights-text" id="sights-text1">The Church of the Saviour on Blood in St. Petersburg is an Orthodox memorial single-altar church in the name of the Resurrection of Christ. It was built in memory of the fact that on March 1 (13), 1881, Emperor Alexander II was mortally wounded in this place as a result of an assassination attempt.
                                    Located in the historical centre of St. Petersburg on the bank of the Griboyedov Canal next to the Mikhailovsky Garden and Stable Square. The height of the nine-headed temple is 81 metres, the capacity is up to 1600 people.
                                    The architecture of the temple is an example of the late stage of the evolution of the «Russian style». The building is a collective image of a Russian Orthodox church, focussed on the samples of Moscow and Yaroslavl of the XVI-XVII centuries. The architecture of St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow had a great influence on the appearance of the temple.
                                    On the outside of the temple there are inscriptions that emphasise the achievements of Russia during the reign of Alexander II. A variety of finishing materials are used in the decor of the building - brick, marble, granite, enamels, gold-plated copper and mosaic.
                                    Inside, the temple is a mosaic museum, the area of which is 7065 square metres. The mosaic was created in the workshop of V. A. Frolov based on sketches of more than 30 artists, among whom were such as V. Min Vasnetsov, F. S. Zhuravlev, M. C Nesterov, A. P. Ryabushkin, V. C Belyaev, N. N. Kharlamov.

                                    Some characteristics of the Kremlin:
                                    It is located on the high left bank of the Moscow River - Borovitsky Hill, at the confluence of the Neglinnaya River.
                                    In the plan, it is an incorrect triangle with an area of 27.5 hectares. The southern wall faces the Moscow River, the northwestern wall faces the Alexander Garden, and the eastern wall faces Red Square.
                                    There are 20 towers on the territory of the Kremlin, the highest is the Spasskaya Tower - its height reaches 71 m.
                                    The architectural ensemble includes 8 cathedrals, among which the most important is the Assumption Cathedral.
                                    The Armoury exhibits ancient jewellery belonging to Russian princes and emperors. The famous Monomakh hat, the best samples of Russian weapons, carriages, a throne are kept here.
                                    The Grand Kremlin Palace is a majestic building where all the most significant festivals, concerts and other events are held.
                                    On the territory of the Moscow Kremlin, you can admire the Tsar Cannon, cast in 1586. It was created to protect the fortress, but in the entire history of its existence, the gun has never fired like this.
                                    The Moscow Kremlin is included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List.

                                    The temple was built in the middle of the 16th century by order of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible to commemorate the conquest of the Kazan Khanate - part of the former Golden Horde - as a sign of gratitude for the victory.
                                    The cathedral has a complex structure. The main pillar-shaped church in honour of the Intercession of the Mother of God is surrounded on four sides by axial churches, between which there are four smaller churches. In the second half of the 17th century, the Tent Bell Tower was added to the complex.
                                    One of the most revered shrines of the temple is the carved arch above the burial of Basil the Blessed.
                                    The main value of the cathedral is its unique iconostasis, which contains more than four hundred icons of the XVI-XIX centuries, made by Novgorod and Moscow masters of church painting.
                                    Today the cathedral is an active cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church and a branch of the Historical Museum.

                        Some features of Ancient Russian literature:
                        The absence of fiction. Fiction was not allowed, as it was considered a lie, and lying is sinful.
                        Anonymity. Many early works had no author, as talent was considered a gift from God, and it was considered blasphemy to appropriate texts written with his help.  
                        Strict canonicity. The works were written according to an established structure, from which it was not supposed to deviate. </p>

In his honor, they sang songs and jumped over bonfires in the evenings. This ritual action evolved into an annual celebration of the summer solstice, blending pagan and Christian traditions. The deity Kupala became known as Ivan after the Christianization of Russia, when he was replaced by none other than John the Baptist (or rather, his folk image), who baptized Christ himself and whose birth was celebrated on June 24th.

                            <p class="tradition-text">In ancient times, Maslenitsa was considered a holiday for commemorating the deceased. Thus, the burning of the Maslenitsa effigy represents a funeral, and the blini (pancakes) are a memorial treat. But time passed, and the Russian people, eager for fun and relaxation, transformed this somber holiday into the boisterous Maslenitsa. The tradition of baking blini remained – round, yellow, and hot like the sun – and was supplemented with troika rides and sledding down icy hills, fistfights, and visits to mothers-in-law. Maslenitsa rituals are very unusual and interesting, as they combine the completion of the winter holiday period and the opening of a new, spring period of holidays and rituals that were intended to contribute to a rich harvest.

                                    Some features of Ancient Russian literature:
                                    The absence of fiction. Fiction was not allowed, as it was considered a lie, and lying is sinful.
                                    Anonymity. Many early works had no author, as talent was considered a gift from God, and it was considered blasphemy to appropriate texts written with his help.  
                                    Strict canonicity. The works were written according to an established structure, from which it was not supposed to deviate. </p>

                                            Cooking dumplings is a family activity. The hostess rolls out the dough, and the rest of the family members put minced meat and make dumplings.</p>
