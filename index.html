                                <p class="sights-text">The Church of the Saviour on Blood in St. Petersburg is an Orthodox memorial single-altar church in the name of the Resurrection of Christ. It was built in memory of the fact that on March 1 (13), 1881, Emperor Alexander II was mortally wounded in this place as a result of an assassination attempt.
                                    Located in the historical centre of St. Petersburg on the bank of the Griboyedov Canal next to the Mikhailovsky Garden and Stable Square. The height of the nine-headed temple is 81 metres, the capacity is up to 1600 people.
                                    The architecture of the temple is an example of the late stage of the evolution of the «Russian style». The building is a collective image of a Russian Orthodox church, focussed on the samples of Moscow and Yaroslavl of the XVI-XVII centuries. The architecture of St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow had a great influence on the appearance of the temple.
                                    On the outside of the temple there are inscriptions that emphasise the achievements of Russia during the reign of Alexander II. A variety of finishing materials are used in the decor of the building - brick, marble, granite, enamels, gold-plated copper and mosaic.
                                    Inside, the temple is a mosaic museum, the area of which is 7065 square metres. The mosaic was created in the workshop of V. A. Frolov based on sketches of more than 30 artists, among whom were such as V. Min Vasnetsov, F. S. Zhuravlev, M. C Nesterov, A. P. Ryabushkin, V. C Belyaev, N. N. Kharlamov.

                                <p class="sights-text">The Moscow Kremlin is a fortress in the centre of Moscow and its oldest part. This is the main socio-political and historical-artistic complex of the city, the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation.
                                    Some characteristics of the Kremlin:
                                    It is located on the high left bank of the Moscow River - Borovitsky Hill, at the confluence of the Neglinnaya River.
                                    In the plan, it is an incorrect triangle with an area of 27.5 hectares. The southern wall faces the Moscow River, the northwestern wall faces the Alexander Garden, and the eastern wall faces Red Square.
                                    There are 20 towers on the territory of the Kremlin, the highest is the Spasskaya Tower - its height reaches 71 m.
                                    The architectural ensemble includes 8 cathedrals, among which the most important is the Assumption Cathedral.
                                    The Armoury exhibits ancient jewellery belonging to Russian princes and emperors. The famous Monomakh hat, the best samples of Russian weapons, carriages, a throne are kept here.
                                    The Grand Kremlin Palace is a majestic building where all the most significant festivals, concerts and other events are held.
                                    On the territory of the Moscow Kremlin, you can admire the Tsar Cannon, cast in 1586. It was created to protect the fortress, but in the entire history of its existence, the gun has never fired like this.
                                    The Moscow Kremlin is included in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List.

                                <p class="sights-text">The Cathedral of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin on the Rva, better known as St. Basil's Cathedral, is located in the southern part of Red Square in Moscow, near the Spassky Gate of the Kremlin, above the descent to the Moscow River.
                                    The temple was built in the middle of the 16th century by order of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible to commemorate the conquest of the Kazan Khanate - part of the former Golden Horde - as a sign of gratitude for the victory.
                                    The cathedral has a complex structure. The main pillar-shaped church in honour of the Intercession of the Mother of God is surrounded on four sides by axial churches, between which there are four smaller churches. In the second half of the 17th century, the Tent Bell Tower was added to the complex.
                                    One of the most revered shrines of the temple is the carved arch above the burial of Basil the Blessed.
                                    The main value of the cathedral is its unique iconostasis, which contains more than four hundred icons of the XVI-XIX centuries, made by Novgorod and Moscow masters of church painting.
                                    Today the cathedral is an active cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church and a branch of the Historical Museum.
